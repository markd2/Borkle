Mind-Mapping for RPG Campaign design and running.

I love love love [Scapple](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scapple/overview), mind-mapping
software from [Literate and Latte](https://www.literatureandlatte.com), the makers of 
[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) (which is also awesome).
I've been using it to design the latest adventure with my DnD group at work.  There's
a [repo](https://github.com/markd2/MarkDnD) with notes and whatnot.

I've been outgrowing it though - I really want Scapple's amazingly simple UI along with
an outline processor, along with some templates for things like NPCs or monster statblocks.

Kinda want Scapple cross-bred with Scrivener.

So, this is my (probably incomplete) attempt of making such a tool before I 
~get distracted~ get a more pressing assignment.
