Please contact me (markd@borkware.com / @borkware) if you'd like to
use this code.  I'm pretty flexible, but because this started as a
clone of an (excellent) existing piece of software, I want to honor
their work until I really start diverging from it and making this code
generally unsuitable for easy adaptation.

I'm fine with anyone taking "ooh, so that's how you can use NSUndoManager" or
"ooh, so that's how you can do complex mouse operations in an NSView" ideas,
but the core concept of creating and editing a mind-map is your own resposibility.
